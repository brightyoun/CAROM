# CAROM

CAROM means "CARs On the Map". It is a framework to track and localize vehicles using monocular traffic monitoring cameras on road infrastructures. The tracking results can be stored in files or in a database as records. Using the results, a traffic scene can be reconstructed and replayed on a map.

Through collaborating with a local transportation department in the United States, we constructed a benchmarking dataset containing GPS data, roadside camera videos, and drone videos to validate the vehicle tracking results. On average, the localization error is approximately 0.8 m and 1.7 m within the range of 50 m and 120 m from the cameras, respectively. More detailed demo videos for qualitative evaluation are shown as follows.

* Validation with aerial videos (site 2)
* Demo videos at site 2 (East Osborn Road, ~10 minutes)
* Demo videos at site 1A (eastbound of the intersection, ~10 minutes)
* Demo videos at site 1B (westbound of the intersection, ~10 minutes)
* Demo videos at site 1C (southbound of the intersection, ~10 minutes)
* Demo videos at site 1D (northbound of the intersection, ~10 minutes)
